This project implements a polynomial time fair division algorithm for computing EFX allocations based on the paper by Caragiannis et al. (2019)[1]

Fair division problems (in the setting of indivisible resources) are about dividing a set of indivisible resources among a set of agents in ways that enforce some measure of fairness - based on the agents individual valuation of each of the resources.
